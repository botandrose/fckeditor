-------

This plugin installs the FCKeditor editor into your rails app, along with some helpers to use in your views.

Install
-------

If you got this using:

ruby script/plugin install svn://rubyforge.org//var/svn/fckeditorp/trunk/fckeditor

Then the install should of copied all the appropriate files to their homes. If you download a tar then you can either do

rake fckeditor:install 

from the root of your app, or the file will be installed the first time you startup after untaring the plugin.

Files
-----

Basically the whole of the FCKeditor suite is copied to: public/javascripts/fckeditor

There is a separate config file copied to: public/javascripts/fckcustom.js, that you can use to customize the install. This file is never overriden by upgrades or reinstalls

Usage
-----

Basically include this in the page you wish to use the editor in

<%= javascript_include_tag :fckeditor %>

Then instead of the normal textarea helper from Rails use this one

<%= fckeditor_textarea("object", "field", :toolbarKit => 'Simple, :width => '400', :height => '200' %>

Thats it unless you are using AJAX

AJAX
----

To use a remote form you need to do something like this

<%= form_remote_tag :url => @options.merge(:controller => @scaffold_controller),
                    :before => fckeditor_before_js('note', 'text') %>

    <%= fckeditor_textarea( "note", "text", :height => '200', :ajax => true ) %> 

<%= end_form_tag %>

If you forget to put in the :before it won't work

Issues / TODO's
------

1) There is a problem with uploading Flash files
2) There are no progress indicators for the AJAX requests from the resource manager
2) ISpell is not yet implemented
3) No real docs....
